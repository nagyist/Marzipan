# What is Marzipan?

Marzipan is a technology, currently in beta and available upon request, that makes it easy(er) to run managed (.NET) code in your native Mac (Cocoa) applications by embedding Mono.

Marzipan is in early development stages, and was mainly conceived due to the need to host Mono and the managed compiler inside [Fire](http://remobjects.com/fire), a project currently under development here at RemObjects Software. Marzipan is made to do exactly what is needed by Fire, and not much more. That said, it is usable, and we want to make it available for everyone to use. Feedback and contributions are appreciated, and we plan to improve this project moving forward.
